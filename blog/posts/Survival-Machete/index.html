		<p>This machete is my first forray into knife making.  It is fabricated from a 14&quot; cold-cutting blade.  A number of the carbide teeth on the blade were damaged, so turning it into a machete would give it a second life as a useful tool.</p>
<p>I set myself a challenge for this project, to complete it using only materials I had on hand. I had the material for the blade, and figured I would either use copper rivets or some steel rod to attach the handle.  Now all I needed was the appropriate material for the handle.</p>
<p><strong>Handle</strong></p>
<p>I checked my scrap wood pile for some useable hardwood, but most of the wood was pine and chestnut.  I  remembered that the power company had taken down a walnut tree in my backyard and neatly stacked the wood in a pile.  I decided I would use that for the handle. Now came the trick of getting useful wood from the log. </p>
<p>With my chainsaw out of commission and lacking a sawmill, I decided to use an axe head and chisel to split the logs.  After that, I ran them through a planer to square them up enough to be ripped into slats on the table saw. </p>
<p>The wood was still a bit green, so I &quot;kiln dried&quot; it in the oven at the Warm setting (170F).  About every half hour I checked the wood&#39;s weight.  Once the weight stopped dropping, I called it dry enough.</p>
<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>
<p>Creating the blade was pretty straight forward.  Since I didn&#39;t have enough material to create the size I wanted, I needed to cut and weld to pieces together.  I drew up the blade in Inkscape, and chunked it up into pieces so that the weld build be completely covered by the handle.  This didn&#39;t go quite as planned, because I ended up cutting the wood a bit short, and it didn&#39;t cover the weld completely. </p>
<p>After welding the blade up, I ground it flat with a grinding disc and flap wheel.  Once that was done, I cleaned up the edge and added a bevel on the belt grinder.</p>
<p><strong>Finishing</strong></p>
<p>I struggled a bit to drill the holes for the handle.  The steel was pretty hard, and I tried to drill to aggressively.  Sure I could have annealed the material, but it was workable enough already and I wanted to avoid the additional steps of tempering or heat-treating afterwards.  What worked was drilling small pilot holes and making a number of passes.  I made about 4 steps between #40 (0.098&quot;) and 0.25&quot;.</p>
<p>I had originally thought I would use steel pins for the handle, since I had it on hand, but I really wanted something hollow so I could hang the blade.  I picked up a length of hollow brass tubing which worked nicely.</p>
<p>To attach the sales, I added some crosshatch using a utility knife and applied a 10-minute epoxy.  There are epoxies with a better shear strength than what I used, but I suspect it will do the job just fine.  Finally, I gave it a coat of Danish Oil to complete it. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t used it too much yet, but it&#39;s head and shoulders above the $10 machete I purchased from Harbor Freight.  I am looking forward to using it to clear brush, among other tasks.   </p>
